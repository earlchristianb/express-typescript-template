Express Typescript setup with Nodemon for Development

Created this template for my upskilling journey :DD I'll try to upskill my Backend Development skills in 30 Days, Day 1 will start new Date(2024,06,21)


I'll be using this and a Nestjs Template that I will create later.

Ideally I will create a express app first then rewrite everything to Nestjs :>
