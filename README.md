# Express Typescript setup with Nodemon for Development

Created this template for my upskilling journey ðŸ¤ž I'll try to upskill my Backend Development skills in 30 Days, Day 1 will start new Date(2024,06,21)


I'll be using this and a Nestjs Template that I will create later.

Ideally I will create a express app first ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8322fce8-9514-4dd2-b15d-d8eadee927ee)
then rewrite everything to Nestjs ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4d89c42-ccf7-47a9-b3bb-32225c8532a6)
