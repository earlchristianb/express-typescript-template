# Express Typescript setup with Nodemon for Development

Created this template for my upskilling journey ðŸ¤ž I'll try to upskill my Backend Development skills in 30 Days, Day 1 will start new Date(2024,06,21)


I'll be using this and a Nestjs Template that I will create later.

Ideally I will create a express app first then ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8322fce8-9514-4dd2-b15d-d8eadee927ee)
 rewrite everything to Nestjs ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/babb415c-b0aa-4683-a5d5-501db35aa010)
